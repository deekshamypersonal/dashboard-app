## Overview

This project tracks when users click **Enroll Now** and **Pay Now** buttons on the frontend. It helps understand how many people show interest in a course by enrolling but do not complete the payment.

The data is collected and displayed in **Grafana** to visualize through graphs. This can help businesses to see how many users actually go from showing interest to making a payment. It also provides insights into the **drop rate**, helping businesses understand how many users abandon the process before completing the payment. This can be used in any application that involves a payment process to analyze user behavior and improve the checkout process.

## Features

- Tracks "Enroll Now" and "Pay Now" events from the frontend.
- Backend uses **Micrometer** to record metrics.
- Stores metrics in **Prometheus**.
- Visualizes data with **Grafana**.
- Helps analyze the **drop rate** (users who enroll but donâ€™t proceed to payment).
- Can be integrated with any application that involves a payment process.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, React
- **Monitoring Tools**: Prometheus, Grafana
